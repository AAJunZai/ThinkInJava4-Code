Barack Obama who is the first black president in America will finish his last term of office soon. He is going to move away the White House and relieve his job as president. I still remember the time when Obama won the election and gave his inspiring speech, he said he wanted to make some changes to America. Now 8 years have passed, his words have been tested. Some people think he is a good president even though they donâ€™t think what Obama brought to the country did not make a big difference. But no one will deny that Obama is very humorous, it is known to all that he likes to watch the TV series. He keeps his eyes on them and sometimes he will play jokes in his personal Facebook. During his last term, he joined the talk show and showed his humor.
